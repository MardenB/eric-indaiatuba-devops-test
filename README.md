## Comprehensive Technical Skills Assessment

**Objective:** This assessment aims to evaluate your foundational proficiency in a range of essential technologies used in modern software development and operations. We are looking to assess your ability to problem-solve, research, and implement solutions using the provided tools.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **GitHub Account:**
    * If you do not already possess a GitHub account, please create one.
2.  **Private Repository:**
    * Create a **PRIVATE** GitHub repository specifically for this assessment.
    * This repository will serve as the central location for all your solutions.
3.  **Repository Sharing:**
    * Share your private repository with the following GitHub usernames: `MardenB` and `fsbsilva`. This will grant us access to review your work.

**Scope of Evaluation:**

This assessment will evaluate your practical skills in the following areas:

* **Python Programming:**
    * Demonstrate your ability to write clear, concise, and functional Python code.
    * Emphasis will be placed on problem-solving, algorithm implementation, and effective use of standard libraries.
* **Shell Scripting (Bash):**
    * Show your capability to automate tasks using Bash scripting.
    * This includes proficiency in command-line utilities, control structures, and variable manipulation.
* **Basic Linux Command-Line Proficiency:**
    * Demonstrate familiarity with essential Linux commands for file manipulation, system navigation, and process management.
    * This will include, but is not limited to, commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `chmod`, and `ps`.
* **Docker Containerization:**
    * Exhibit your understanding of Docker by creating and managing containerized applications.
    * This includes building Docker images, running containers, and understanding Dockerfile syntax.
* **Kubernetes and Helm (Container Orchestration and Package Management):**
    * Demonstrate your ability to deploy and manage applications on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
    * This will involve understanding basic Kubernetes concepts such as deployments, services, and pods, as well as the ability to customize and deploy Helm charts.

**Assessment Methodology:**

* The assessment will consist of a series of practical problems that require you to apply the aforementioned technologies.
* We expect you to leverage online resources, documentation, and libraries to solve the given tasks.
* Emphasis will be placed on your ability to:
    * Understand the problem requirements.
    * Develop effective solutions.
    * Write well-structured and documented code/scripts.
    * Demonstrate a systematic approach to problem-solving.
    * Search for relevant information and use it to solve the given problems.
    * Ability to read and understand technical documentation.
* The primary goal is to assess your ability to learn and adapt, rather than your memorization of specific syntax or commands.
